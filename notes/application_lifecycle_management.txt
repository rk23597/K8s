Rolling updates & Rollback

Key Point to remember

Deployment Strategy - 
1- Recreate - it will first down all the pod and start recreating and there will be downtime
2- Rolling update - ( default ) there will be no downtime if we are going with rolling update

to check the rollout status - 

kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment

TO rollback -

kubectl rollout undo  deployment/myapp-deployment 

to see the histroy of deployment 

kubectl rollout history  deployment/myapp-deployment
